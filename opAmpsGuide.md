## Microchip MCP601 Opamp


## We are designing a opamp with the following requirements:
1.	positive gain, since we want to use the full range of our ADC. This will lead to higher resolution values.
2.	Positive DC offset, since the input signal is Vpp = 2V around V= 0, whereas our ADC takes Vmax=3.3V and Vmin  =0 V 

## Electrical Characteristics of the MCP601 Opamp
*	Vdd - Vss = 7.0V
*	Current at input pints: +- 2mA
*	Max Output Current: +-30mA
